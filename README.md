Data Engineer Challenge - Damavis 2023

I have prepared 4 versions of the program

labyrinth.py is a basic algorith that resolve the 4 acceptance test labyrinths

labyrinthBreadthFirstSearch.py is a basic BreadthFirstSearch algorithm for a 1x1 rod that I used to understand how to implement that for a 1x3 rod

labyrinthBreadthFirstSearch2.py is another basic BFS algorithm to me understand better how it works

labyrinthBreadthFirstSearch3.py is the implementantion of a 1x1 rod and a 1x3 rod
    - not working for the second acceptance test case
    - implementing the restrictions to the size of the rod, in this version I just control the center of the rod and the rest is invisible
    - I could improve the variables using classes (objects)
    - I could implement additional tests using unittest
    - I could test the labyrinth itself to verify if its valid (size, dimensions, valid exit)

Thanks for the opportunity and I hope to be part of this great team
